Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
Initially , I setup a method of parsing the input argument and properly 
inputing them into the variables/array needed using printf to verify the 
output would be correct. Next I created execvp functionalit in the child
and parent and verifying the commands would run properly. Then I used dup2 
to copy the execvp command from child to parent. Finally I set the execvp
= to int variables if = -1 print command (command input) not found.

Actual Time	04 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
Using strsep was interesting how it moved the pointer and made it
easy to parse the command arguments. I'm not sure I fully understand 
dup2 and would like to explore it in a more complex way.
