================================================================
Start 5:30
Estimated Time	04 00
Plan:
first was to open/create the file and write them encrypted code
after first test I needed to chmod to change permissions so I can 
check the encryption. After that I added user permissions to make
it easier especially so I wouldn't need to change permission to
be able to decrypt. I used the same code for decryption and just
changed some values. 
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete 8:30
Actual Time	03 00
Observations:
I'd like to use a more complicated method of encrypting but didn't
want to risk problems with assignment compliance.


(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
