Plan: My initial thoughts were to create an array to scan the files in.
Realizing I just need a simple count it seemed an array would doube the work
after getting the byte size with read() I used that for total chars
after that I ran a while loop using getchar(fptr) counting up lines and words
lines came after checking for the ascii integer for \n. words were more complicated
the were counted after any ascii value of " " and \n not preceeded by a " " or \n.

Observations:
it was easy for me to understand the logic of the operation I wanted to do,
but my unfamiliarity of C slowed me down significantly. It should have only 
taken an hour to complete. It was a good lesson and gives me something new to
challenge myself with.
