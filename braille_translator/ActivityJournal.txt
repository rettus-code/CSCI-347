Start
Estimated Time	4 0
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
first I tackled opening and reading the file, folllowed by passing
the data to ascii to brail and returning a simple braille value. I 
wanted to get the other processes done before converting the values
from there I created a double pointer to contain the braille values
pass it to the write function to verify it was passing it correctly.
Then created the format to print to the outfile and once I was happy
with that I tackled the process of converting the ascii to their 
actual values followed by validating the correct values printed. 

Complete
Actual Time	16 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
Initially created a 2d array to avoid using malloc and found it
seemed to complicate things more. After swithing to a double 
pointer, I was more easile able to pass the pointers I needed.
Also formatting was a challenge, I was uncertain about some of the 
specifics regarding end of line in the outfile. By in all a 
challenging assignment that I should have spent more time on to 
properly implement the code.
