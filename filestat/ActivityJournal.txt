Start 3:30
Estimated Time	03 00
Plan:
First I loaded the file argument into the address of file_details
started with a switch case, but due to chasing an unrelated bug switched to 
if else to determine file type. Did some reading on time library and
learned how to implement strftime and localtime. After that it was pretty
simple to create if else statments checking for permissions. By the time this
was completed moving on to the extra credit was just figuring out 
the st_.... return types for printf.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete 6:40
Actual Time	03 10
Observations:
Reading up on the libraries can be very helpful. 
Some good resources that I found:

(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
