Name:Michael Rettus and Griffin Craft

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	16 00
Plan:
Griffin focused on myshell and argparse while I would work on 
builtin. Once we had a generic running version we tested it to
identify errors and debug. Once the general shell was working 
added _ls (ls) to complete the project. With extra time added
color codes to path, files and directories to make a visual 
distinction and the ability to print in a vertical list with
_ls -l

Complete
Actual Time	~ 12 30
Observations:
Working in a team is a great exercise and one we enjoyed. It pushes
individuals to work harder to not let each other down. Downside 
is a loss of understanding of the what the different parts of
code are doing since we were not directly involved with it. We had
to spend additional time after to learn how it all worked. This 
is a realistic expectation of collaboration and we understand 
it's not always necesary to know how all parts of it work.
